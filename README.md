# wisdompets
Wisdom Pets is a web application built using the Python Django framework that provides a platform for pet owners to share their experiences and knowledge about taking care of their pets.

## Usage
1. First, since this project is written using django 3.3.0, and there is a high chance that you don't have this specific version, I advise you to use the virtual environment provided here. To use it, type on your terminal "python -m venv virtual_env".
2. Second, and final step is to start the development server by typing "python manage.py runserver".
